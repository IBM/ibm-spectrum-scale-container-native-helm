IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access {{ .Chart.AppVersion }} and
IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Driver {{ .Values.csiVersion }} components were deployed as 
in the following namespaces
- ibm-spectrum-scale
- ibm-spectrum-scale-operator
- ibm-spectrum-scale-csi
with the associated Helm chart release "{{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }}"
living in the "{{ .Release.Namespace }}" namespace.

The deployed Helm chart can be listed with:
# helm list -A
# helm list -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Verify that all IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native pods enter a running state:
# oc get pods -n ibm-spectrum-scale -w

Verify that all IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Driver pods enter a running state:
# oc get pods -n ibm-spectrum-scale-csi -w

This Helm chart is only intended to provide ease of use for an initial deployment 
with helm install for Proof of Concepts (PoCs), demos or any other form of evaluations 
where no further lifecycle managment or upgrade paths are considered. 
It is explicitely not intended and not supported for any production use and 
does not provide support for any lifecycle management, especially, 
"helm upgrade|rollback|uninstall" features are not supported.
