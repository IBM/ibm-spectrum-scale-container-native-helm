IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access {{ .Values.cnsaVersion }} and
IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Driver {{ .Values.csiVersion }} components were deployed
in the following namespaces
- ibm-spectrum-scale
- ibm-spectrum-scale-operator
- ibm-spectrum-scale-csi
with the associated Helm chart release "{{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }}"
linked to the release namespace "{{ .Release.Namespace }}".

The deployed Helm chart can be listed with:
# helm list -A
# helm list -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Verify that the IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native operator pod is running:
# oc get pods -n ibm-spectrum-scale-operator

Wait until all IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native pods are in a running state:
# oc get pods -n ibm-spectrum-scale

Wait until all IBM Spectrum Scale CSI driver pods are in a running state:
# oc get pods -n ibm-spectrum-scale-csi

This Helm chart is only intended to provide ease of use for an initial deployment,
"helm upgrade|rollback|uninstall" features are not supported.

To remove IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access please follow the instructions at:
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative?topic=5114-cleaning-up-container-native-cluster

Complete removal of the IBM Spectrum Scale CNSA and CSI Helm chart deployment involves the following steps on OpenShift: 
# oc delete deployment ibm-spectrum-scale-controller-manager -n ibm-spectrum-scale-operator
# oc delete  csiscaleoperators ibm-spectrum-scale-csi -n ibm-spectrum-scale-csi
# helm uninstall ibm-spectrum-scale -n ibm-spectrum-scale
# oc delete -f helm/ibm-spectrum-scale/crds
# oc delete pv -lapp.kubernetes.io/instance=ibm-spectrum-scale,app.kubernetes.io/name=pmcollector
# oc delete sc -lapp.kubernetes.io/instance=ibm-spectrum-scale,app.kubernetes.io/name=pmcollector
# oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker --no-headers | while read a b; do echo "## $a ##"; oc debug node/$a -- chroot /host sh -c "rm -rf /var/mmfs; rm -rf /var/adm/ras"; sleep 5; done
# oc label node --all scale.spectrum.ibm.com/role- scale.spectrum.ibm.com/designation- scale-

A complete removal also requires the following clean up steps on the remote storage cluster:
# mmauth delete ibm-spectrum-scale.[your-OpenShift-domain]
# mmunlinkfileset [your-file-system-name] primary-fileset-[your-file-system-name]-[your-former-CNSA-cluster-ID]
# mmdelfileset [your-file-system-name] primary-fileset-[your-file-system-name]-[your-former-CNSA-cluster-ID] -f
