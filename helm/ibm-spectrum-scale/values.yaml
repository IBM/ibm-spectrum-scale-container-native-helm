# Default Helm chart values for the deployment of
#  - IBM Spectrum Scale Container Native Storage Access v5.1.1.4
#  - IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Driver v2.3.1
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: With the default configuration IBM Spectrum Scale services 
#       will be deployed on all OpenShift worker nodes. You can add 
#       specific nodeSelectors in the Cluster CR section below.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

## -----------------------
##  Predefined Namespaces
## -----------------------

# The deployment will create and use the following namespaces as listed below.
# These namespaces are not configurable because further K8s objects are created 
# and managed by the operators which are beyond the control of the Helm chart.
# The namespaces will not be removed by Helm with helm uninstall.
# The namespace manifests are located in the crds/ directory and will be
# applied automatically if not already created.
#
#   CNSA namespace:           ibm-spectrum-scale
#   CNSA Operator namespace:  ibm-spectrum-scale-operator
#   CSI  namespace:           ibm-spectrum-scale-csi

# REQUIRED: The secrets for a CNSA and CSI user to access the GUI of the remote IBM Spectrum Scale storage cluster
#           are required. They must either be created manually prior to installation or can be created through

# NOTE: Having plain text passwords in this config file is a security risk! Handle this file accordingly!

# createSecrets: No secrets will be created by the Helm chart if set to false. 
#                In this case all secrets and all namespaces must have been created prior to installation.
